# tennis-score-state

There are games within a set and points within games.The deuce/advantage rule within games is implemented. The tie-break rule is implemented at the set level. The winner is the player who wins the set.
A set is made of 6 games - except if both players reach 5 games before the end of the set  => then the first player who reach 7 games wins the set.
The score is displayed in the program console (eg. Eclipse  or IntelliJ console).
