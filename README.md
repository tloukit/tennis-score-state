# tennis-score-state
Java implementation of a tennis scoring system machine using the State Pattern. We implement only one set.
Here we consider the tennis scoring system as a FSA ( Finished State Automata) since it has a beginning (start of the set) and an end ( end of the set and a winner)
The score is diplayed in the program console (eg. Eclipse  or IntelliJ console)
Just run the programm in the class named "Main" -> Run As/ Java Application
