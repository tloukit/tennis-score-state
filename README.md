# tennis-score-state
Java implementation of a tennis scoring system machine using the State Pattern
Here we consider the tennis scoring system as a FSA ( Finished State Automata) since it has a beginning (start of the match) and an end ( end of match and a winner)
The score is diplayed in the program console (eg. Eclipse  or IntelliJ console)
